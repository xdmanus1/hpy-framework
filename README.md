**Initialize, configure, build, serve, and live-reload web applications from structured `.hpy` projects (HTML + CSS + Python + Static Assets) using the magic of [Brython](https://brython.info)! ‚ú®**

`hpy-tool` streamlines creating interactive web applications by processing `.hpy` files, external Python scripts, static assets, and directories. Define shared layouts and individual pages, keeping structure (`<html>`), styling (`<style>`), and client-side logic (`<python>` or external `.py`) organized. Use a simple `hpy.toml` file for project configuration. `hpy-tool` bundles everything into standard HTML files where your Python code runs directly in the browser, powered by Brython, and manages your static assets and external scripts.

Inspired by the simplicity of tools like SvelteKit, this tool aims to provide a straightforward development experience for Brython-based projects.

## Project Status & Disclaimer

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please Note:** This project is currently maintained primarily as a learning exercise. While it aims to be functional and useful for the described use cases, it's still under development. There might be bugs, rough edges, or areas for improvement. Treat it as **experimental**. Feedback, bug reports, and contributions are highly encouraged!

## Core Features (v0.7.x)

*   üöÄ **Project Initialization:** (`--init`) Quickly scaffold a new project with a default layout, example pages (using inline, conventional `.py`, and explicit `<python src="...">`), `hpy.toml` configuration, a scripts directory, and a static assets directory.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Configuration:** (`hpy.toml`) Define common settings like input source directory, output directory, and static asset directory name in a simple TOML file at the project root. CLI flags override `hpy.toml` settings.
*   üìÅ **Directory-Based Workflow:** Process an entire source directory (`src/` by default, configurable via `hpy.toml`) containing your layout, page files, Python scripts, and static assets.
*   üìÑ **Layout Support:** Define a global `_layout.hpy` for shared HTML structure, CSS, and Python logic. Page content is injected automatically. Layout Python runs before page Python.
*   üß© **Single-File Pages:** Write individual page content and logic in separate `.hpy` files within your source directory.
*   üêç **Flexible Python Logic:**
    *   Write Python directly inside `<python>...</python>` blocks in your `.hpy` files.
    *   **Convention:** Place page logic in `page.py` alongside `page.hpy`. `hpy-tool` automatically uses it.
    *   **Explicit:** Use `<python src="path/to/script.py">` within `page.hpy` to link any `.py` file (relative path). This overrides conventional and inline Python for that page.
*   üñºÔ∏è **Static Asset Handling:** Automatically copies files from a designated static directory (e.g., `src/static/`) to the output directory (e.g., `dist/static/`) during builds and keeps them synced in watch mode (requires `static_dir_name` in `hpy.toml`).
*   üêç **Brython Integration:** Automatically includes the Brython runtime. Manages inline scripts, external script copying/linking, and helper function injection.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Compilation:** Builds HTML files corresponding to your source `.hpy` pages, applying the layout and linking/embedding Python correctly. Copies/processes associated Python scripts.
*   üöÄ **Development Server:** (`-s`, `-p`) Instantly serves your compiled application locally from the output directory with no-cache headers.
*   üîÑ **Live Rebuilding & Syncing:** (`-w`) Automatically recompiles `.hpy` files, syncs static assets, and copies/updates associated `.py` files when source files change (requires `watchdog`). Handles dependencies between `.hpy` and `.py` files.
*   üó£Ô∏è **Verbose Mode:** (`-v`) Provides detailed logs for build steps, script/static file operations, and server activity.
*   üí° **DOM Helpers:** Automatically injects `byid()`, `qs()`, `qsa()` helpers into the global scope (accessible from layout, inline, and external scripts).
*   üèóÔ∏è **Refactored Codebase:** Internal code organized into the `hpy_core` package for better maintainability.

## Ideal For

*   ‚ö° Building small to medium-sized web applications or dashboards with Python in the browser, including static assets like images and CSS.
*   üéì Learning and experimenting with Brython in a structured project setup with configuration and flexible script organization.
*   üì¶ Creating interactive documentation examples or simple UI components.
*   ‚ö° Rapid prototyping where code organization and configuration are helpful.

## Installation

A Python virtual environment is strongly recommended.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (if you haven't)
python -m venv .venv
# Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (CMD):
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows (PowerShell):
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install hpy-tool
# Option A: From PyPI (once published)
# pip install hpy-tool

# Option B: From local source code (for development)
# Navigate to the directory containing pyproject.toml
pip install -e .

# Note: This installs 'watchdog' (needed for -w) and 'tomli' (for hpy.toml on Python < 3.11) automatically.
```

## Getting Started: New Project

1.  **Initialize a Project:**

    ```bash
    hpy --init my-new-app
    cd my-new-app
    ```
    This creates a directory-based project (default):
    ```
    my-new-app/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hpy.toml        # Project configuration file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/            # Default source directory
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _layout.hpy   # Shared layout file
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.hpy     # Example page (uses index.py)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.py      # Conventional external script
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.hpy     # Example page (uses explicit src)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/      # Directory for shared/explicit scripts
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about_logic.py # Script referenced by about.hpy
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static/       # Static asset directory
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logo.svg  # Example static file
    ```
    *(Review `hpy.toml` - you may need to uncomment `static_dir_name`)*

2.  **Run the Dev Server with Watch:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are inside 'my-new-app' directory
    hpy -w
    ```
    *(No source directory argument needed! `hpy` reads `input_dir` from `hpy.toml` or uses the default "src". `-w` enables watching, building, script/static sync, and serving)*

3.  **Open your browser:** Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port). Explore the Home (`/`) and About (`/about.html`) pages. Check the browser console for `print` statements.
4.  **Develop!** Edit files in the `src/` directory (`.hpy`, `.py`, static assets).
5.  **Save:** Save your changes. The tool will automatically rebuild/sync. Refresh your browser!

## Project Structure Explained

*   **`hpy.toml` (Project Root):** Configuration file for `hpy-tool`. Defines input/output directories, static asset folder name, etc.
*   **`src/` (or your configured `input_dir`):** Contains all your source `.hpy` files, associated `.py` files (conventional or in subdirectories), and the static asset directory.
*   **`src/static/` (or your configured `static_dir_name`):** Holds static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts). Contents are copied directly to the output directory under the same name (e.g., `dist/static/`). Requires `static_dir_name` in `hpy.toml`.
*   **`src/_layout.hpy` (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Defines the main HTML structure (`<head>`, `<body>`, shared elements).
    *   Must contain `<!-- HPY_PAGE_CONTENT -->` where page content is injected.
    *   Can contain global `<style>` and `<python>` blocks (inline only). Layout Python runs before page Python.
*   **`src/*.hpy` (Page Files):**
    *   Contain specific page content (`<html>` section replaces the layout placeholder).
    *   Can contain page-specific `<style>`.
    *   Can optionally contain inline `<python>` *or* a `<python src="...">` tag *or* rely on a conventional `*.py` file alongside it.
*   **`src/*.py` or `src/**/*.py` (External Python Scripts):**
    *   **Conventional:** If `page.py` exists alongside `page.py`, it's automatically used (unless overridden by `src`).
    *   **Explicit:** Referenced using `<python src="relative/path/to/script.py">` within an `.hpy` file. The path is relative to the `.hpy` file.

## `.hpy` File Structure Guide

*   **`<html>...</html>`:** Contains the HTML fragment. (Required).
*   **`<style>...</style>`:** Contains CSS rules. Multiple tags are concatenated. (Optional).
*   **`<python>...</python>`:** Contains inline Brython (Python 3) code. Multiple tags are concatenated. (Optional). **This block is ignored if a corresponding `*.py` file exists or if `<python src="...">` is used in the same file.**
*   **`<python src="path/script.py">`:** Specifies an external Python script file to use for this page's logic. (Optional).
    *   The `path` is relative to the location of the `.hpy` file.
    *   The resolved script path **must** reside within the project's input directory (e.g., `src/`) and **must not** be inside the static asset directory.
    *   If present, this takes precedence over both conventional `*.py` files and inline `<python>` blocks.
    *   Only the first `<python src="...">` tag found is used.

**Important Notes:**
*   Ensure Python code inside `<python>` or `.py` files starts with no leading indentation (unless within functions/classes).
*   The layout file must contain `<!-- HPY_PAGE_CONTENT -->`.
*   CSS from layout/pages is combined globally.
*   Python helpers (`byid`, `qs`, `qsa`) are injected globally and available in layout, inline, and external scripts. Layout Python runs first, then the page script (inline or external).
*   Static asset handling requires `static_dir_name` to be set (uncommented) in `hpy.toml`.

### Simplified DOM Access

These helpers are automatically available globally:

*   `byid(id)`: Returns element or `None`.
*   `qs(selector)`: Returns first matching element or `None`.
*   `qsa(selector)`: Returns a list of matching elements.

## Command-Line Usage

```
usage: hpy [-h] [--init PROJECT_DIR] [-o DIR] [-v] [-s] [-p PORT] [-w] [--version] [SOURCE]

HPY Tool: Compile/serve .hpy projects. Configurable via hpy.toml.

# ... (rest of CLI help remains the same as previous version) ...

Examples:
  hpy --init my_app          # Initialize project 'my_app' (creates hpy.toml, src/, scripts/, static/)
  hpy                        # Compile project (uses settings from hpy.toml or defaults 'src' -> 'dist')
  hpy -o build               # Compile project, overriding output dir to 'build'
  hpy app_source -o public   # Compile specific input dir, overriding output dir
  hpy page.hpy -o build      # Compile single file (no layout/static/external script handling) to build/page.html
  hpy -w                     # Watch (src -> dist via hpy.toml/defaults), build, sync static/scripts, and serve
  hpy -w -p 8080             # Watch and serve on port 8080
  hpy src/app.hpy -w         # Watch single file (layout/static/external script NOT automatically used)

Configuration (hpy.toml in project root):
  [tool.hpy]
  input_dir = "src"      # Default: "src"
  output_dir = "dist"    # Default: "dist"
  static_dir_name = "static" # Default: "static" (Must be set to enable static handling)

Precedence: CLI Arguments > hpy.toml Settings > Built-in Defaults
```

## How it Works

When processing a directory, `hpy-tool` first checks `hpy.toml` for configuration. It then copies static assets (if configured). It parses the layout (if present). For each page file (`.hpy` outside static dir), it parses the file to determine its Python source:
1. Checks for `<python src="path/script.py">`. If valid, resolves the path.
2. If no valid `src`, checks for a conventional `page.py` alongside `page.hpy`.
3. If neither external source is found, uses inline `<python>` content from the `.hpy`.

It then copies and injects helpers into the determined external `.py` script (if applicable), calculates the relative path for the HTML `<script>` tag, combines CSS, merges page HTML into the layout, and generates the final output HTML file. The watcher monitors the source directory (including static, `.hpy`, and relevant `.py` files) and triggers rebuilds or file synchronization, respecting the dependencies between `.hpy` and `.py` files.
