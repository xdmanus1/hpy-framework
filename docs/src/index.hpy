<h1>Introduction to HPY Tool ⚡</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for <code>hpy-tool</code>, a command-line utility designed to build and serve web applications from <code>.hpy</code> files using Brython.</p>
<p>This tool aims to simplify the development workflow for creating interactive, Python-powered web interfaces by organizing HTML structure, CSS styling, and client-side Python logic within single-component files or structured projects with layouts.</p>
<p><strong>Key Goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a simple, intuitive structure for web projects using Python in the browser.</li>
    <li>Automate the process of combining layout, pages, and static assets.</li>
    <li>Integrate seamlessly with Brython for client-side Python execution.</li>
    <li>Offer a smooth development experience with features like project initialization and live reloading.</li>
</ul>
